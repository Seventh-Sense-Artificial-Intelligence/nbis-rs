/*  Purpose   
    =======   

    SGEMV  performs one of the matrix-vector operations   

       y := alpha*A*x + beta*y,   or   y := alpha*A'*x + beta*y,   

    where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an   
    m by n matrix.   

    Parameters   
    ==========   

    TRANS  - CHARACTER*1.   
             On entry, TRANS specifies the operation to be performed as   
             follows:   

                TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   y := alpha*A*x + beta*y.   

                TRANS = 'T' or 't'   y := alpha*A'*x + beta*y.   

                TRANS = 'C' or 'c'   y := alpha*A'*x + beta*y.   

             Unchanged on exit.   

    M      - INTEGER.   
             On entry, M specifies the number of rows of the matrix A.   
             M must be at least zero.   
             Unchanged on exit.   

    N      - INTEGER.   
             On entry, N specifies the number of columns of the matrix A. 
  
             N must be at least zero.   
             Unchanged on exit.   

    ALPHA  - REAL            .   
             On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.   
             Unchanged on exit.   

    A      - REAL             array of DIMENSION ( LDA, n ).   
             Before entry, the leading m by n part of the array A must   
             contain the matrix of coefficients.   
             Unchanged on exit.   

    LDA    - INTEGER.   
             On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared 
  
             in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least   
             max( 1, m ).   
             Unchanged on exit.   

    X      - REAL             array of DIMENSION at least   
             ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ) when TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   
             and at least   
             ( 1 + ( m - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ) otherwise.   
             Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the   
             vector x.   
             Unchanged on exit.   

    INCX   - INTEGER.   
             On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of   
             X. INCX must not be zero.   
             Unchanged on exit.   

    BETA   - REAL            .   
             On entry, BETA specifies the scalar beta. When BETA is   
             supplied as zero then Y need not be set on input.   
             Unchanged on exit.   

    Y      - REAL             array of DIMENSION at least   
             ( 1 + ( m - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ) when TRANS = 'N' or 'n'   
             and at least   
             ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ) otherwise.   
             Before entry with BETA non-zero, the incremented array Y   
             must contain the vector y. On exit, Y is overwritten by the 
  
             updated vector y.   

    INCY   - INTEGER.   
             On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of   
             Y. INCY must not be zero.   
             Unchanged on exit.
